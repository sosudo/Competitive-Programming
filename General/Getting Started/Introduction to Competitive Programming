Solving problems in a two-step process:

1) Algorithm Design

2) Algorithm Implementation

Time Limit - 2 sec
Memory Limit - 256 mb

On a Bronze problem - Stop after 15-20 minutes of no progress
Silver - 30-40 minutes of no progress
Gold - 45-60 minutes
Platinum - 60-80 minutes
Advanced - 75-100 minutes

Skimming through the I/O of a problem beforehand can help understand what's happening in the problem

Pseudocode can help format the algorithm further
