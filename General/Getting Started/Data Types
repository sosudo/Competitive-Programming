Signed integers can be negative or positive while unsigned integers are only positive
Shorts are 16 bits long while longs are 32 bits long
(Long longs are 64 bits long)
ints are signed by defauls and their length can vary based on the platform (16 bits guaranteed)
bools are used as booleans
floats are single precision, doubles are double precision, long doubles have extended precision
floating types in cpp can have special values:
1) infinity
2) negative infinity
3) negative zero
4) NaN

Character addition and subtraction leads to an ASCII operation
printf("%.9f\n", x); will print the floating number x to 9 decimal points

typedef can be used to rewrite types instead of #define

If the type must be inferred, auto can be used instead of a traditional type declaration
