For file IO, one must use:

#include <fstream>
#define cin fin
#define cout fout
using namespace std;
int main() {
  ifstream cin(file);
  ofstream cout(file);
}

Arrays should be declared in the global scope in order to prevent garbage initialization

IO can be optimized by putting the following lines at the top of the code:
ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
cin.tie(0);

scanf is faster than cin and printf is faster than cout
This difference can be rendered negligible, as seen in Fast IO

getline can be used to fetch the value of an entire line, as such:
string x;
getline(cin, x);

The following can also be used for file IO:
freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);
